# Holiday Reservation in Java

Akin to the B&amp;B project, the idea was to create a way from a user to put down a reservation for a location, as well standard date and user data checking. 


This project can be called the parent of the later C++ one, as it was created about three or four months before it. I think having both on here shows to some extent the progress in understanding, capability and just general progress in my coding.
